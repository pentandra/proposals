# General approach

To us, the essence of commoning is sharing how, why, and what we do. To do
this, we need a way to explicitly share our practice. Decision trees describe
patterns of practice (or _behavior_) that can be used as an analytical tool to
study and refine practices themselves, and can even be used as semi-automated
workflows to guide the practice of research _going forward_. We see decision
trees being valuable in describing any process that happens in the course of
research, not just in a handful of cherry-picked types of situations.

This concept of decision trees carries some echoes of what Cameron Neylon has
called for in his blog post [<cite>GitHub for science? Shouldnâ€™t we perhaps
build TCP/IP first?</cite>][tcp/ip] We need some way to describe the processes
and practices of research in a way that opens that understanding to both humans
as well as machines, in a uniform way, across implementations, domains, tools,
and people. The approach we are taking is to describe the processes using RDF
vocabularies, one of which will be created as part of this proposal.

SVG will be used for the visual representation of these decision trees for the
reason that they are portable, and the SVG Tiny [1.2]{.oldstyle} specification
allows [embedded RDFa attributes][SVGTiny metadata] that will allow the data
represented by these trees (not just the authoring metadata, but the purpose
and intent of each node of the decision tree) to be accessible to machines as
well as humans. This is a critical distinction that will enable these decision
trees to actually be used by machines to simplify and assist in the process of
research.

Of course, the idea with these decision trees is not to mandate specific
research practices, but to create a way to practice and share our patterns of
practice in a collaborative, peer-to-peer sort of way. If we do this right,
decision trees will enable a more streamlined, even joyful experience, and
people will be empowered in their efforts to reach the greatest potential for
themselves and for their research.

# Project plan

The high-level deliverables for this proposal include:

* A [decision-tree workflow][workflow] for creating decision trees
* The creation of the [research intent ontology][] to describe the research
  process and affordances within the practice of research
* [Guidance and documentation][] on the patterns and vocabularies used in this
  approach
* A selection of [example decision trees][]
* Put all of the above [on the Web][]

## Workflow

In the spirit of practicing what we preach, our intent in this proposal is to
use decision trees to create a workflow for creating decision trees. This
workflow will use the [research intent ontology] in conjunction with the
[design intent ontology] and the W3C Provenance ontology (among others) and
take someone step-by-step through the process of creating a decision tree.

This proposal will also include a proof-of-concept to convert from a textual
representation of a decision tree (e.g. in Turtle syntax) to other RDF
representations using RDF/XML, HTML/RDFa, JSON-LD in an automated way. This
mechanism will also be able to output an SVG diagram with embedded metadata
using the supplied design template, as well as convert from the SVG back to
another RDF representation.

## Research Intent Ontology

In order to facilitate the commoning interactions that are needed for designing
and using a decision tree, we need every piece of the tree open to machines,
not just the authoring metadata. Because of this, using a generic decision tree
tool will not be adequate. We are proposing to create an ontology to describe
the pieces of the research process and how they fit together. This ontology
will be used in addition to other ontologies and open standards, and is needed
in order to appropriately model the pieces we need to talk about when we talk
about scholarly commoning.

This ontology will also be used to describe affordances, or potential actions
made possible by a given object or environment,[^affordance] for research. Most
of the time these affordances are domain-specific, but there are also many that
are not domain-specific---that are used to accomplish such activities as
annotating a document or asking a question.

## Guidance and documentation

Every effort will be made to preserve the processes undertaken during the
research and design of the ontology and workflows, so that this journey can be
open for others to learn from or extend. The idea is that decision trees as
well as other open structures will be used to guide people in developing or
using other decision trees.

We will also include other documentation as is necessary.

## Example decision trees

We will start with the decision trees that have been created as part of Work
Product 3 of the Scholarly Commons Working Group as examples to learn from in
designing. The workflow for creating decision trees will also function as an
extended example of a fairly complex decision tree. Other examples may be
included as seems helpful.

## On the Web

During the period of the work, these examples and supporting documentation will
be shared under a page dedicated to this project on
[pentandra.com]{.domainname}. If desired, these can also be put on
[scholarlycommons.org]{.domainname}, but that would require further discussion
as to how to proceed with that, and is not currently part of this proposal. 

## Risks

### Where's the user experience?

As the emphasis in this proposal is on creating a mechanism to describe the practice of
research, the implementation of the decision tree workflow for this proposal
will use a rather simple textual user interface. This has a number of benefits.
First, it will put the focus where it needs to be at this point, to make sure
that the workflow is right without the distraction of a graphical user
interface. It is more important to make sure that we can openly (to humans and
machines) describe, streamline, and simplify the process of research. Also
given the short time frame of this solicitation, we think it would not be
prudent to rush the development of these foundational structures in order to
try to develop a good user experience in such a short time period. Second, it
will be easier for others to take these simple ideas and implement them more
easily in their own software projects and platforms.

A companion proposal will be forthcoming to take on creating a more visual user
experience in a more fully-functioning open-research environment that would
also serve as a prototype of scholarly commoning.

### Implications

Yes, we are implying that every piece of scholarship is valued not just to
people, but to machines as well. People and machines need to know not just what
the pieces are, but how they fit together as well. By addressing each piece
independently as a piece of scholarship, we are acknowledging a change and
shift in what we value as scholarly contributions. This may seem very strange
or unusual to some, but we feel that the benefit will be absolutely worth it
and open the door to the Scholarly Commons.

# Responses

Reuse of existing, open-source components wherever possible

:   Yes, we will be using a variety of open-source libraries, ontologies, as
    much as possible

Reduction of number of steps required to make a commons-compliant object

:   Yes, even though we are doing a textual interface for the proof-of-concept
    included in this proposal, and it will require knowledge of a textual
    representation (e.g. Turtle or a DSL), it will take two steps to create a
    decision tree:

    1. Write a declarative representation of the decision tree.
    2. Generate the representations.

Should be both human and machine readable

:   Yes, see [above][research intent ontology].

The final trees should be static but hyperlinked

:   Yes, even the proof-of-concept will create static SVG diagrams that can
    have embedded hyperlinks and linked data.

Each should have a persistent identifier and include versioning capabilities

:   The persistent identifier and versioning capabilities are handled in the
    linked metadata. In the proof-of-concept, this will be more a manual
    process.

There should be a manual/template to enable adaptation by others

:   Yes, this is handled in the [guidance and documentation] section above, and
    this will target both developers and researchers.

Need to be able to create new trees and new versions of existing ones

:   You can copy a representation (textual or SVG) and edit at will. We will
    use a common resource version pattern for versioning in the
    proof-of-concept.

Need to be able to provide granular feedback in a simple way

:   We will be using the [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is){.domainname} client
    with the proof-of-concept to elicit feedback during the design process.

Need to be downloadable

:   Check.

Need to link them to authoring metadata (how to cite them)

:   We will use unique identifiers for the author and any other contributors,
    and these data will be embedded within the decision tree representation.

Need to be exportable into and importable from standard formats

:   We will be generating representations of the decision trees in all common
    RDF syntaxes.

Users should be able to comment on any node or decision point

:   Every node or decision point will have a unique identifier on which
    comments can be made.

Need to link with one or more external repositories

:   The companion proposal describes a system that functions as a repository as
    well.

Additional credit will be given to proposals that consider [508]{.oldstyle} compliance

:   The SVG format is textual and consideration will be given to make these
    objects as accessible to those with disabilities as possible.

Interoperability with other open source components

:   Other than being interoperable with SVG editors, the decision trees at the
    beginning will not be interoperable as far as the research process goes
    until open-source components are built to use the decision trees in the
    research process.
