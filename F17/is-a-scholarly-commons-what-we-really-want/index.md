# Description

The term "Scholarly Commons" has been used much of late, but it often feels
like we are not all talking about the same thing. In a short talk or poster the
differences between a "Scholarly Commons" and a few other possible
organizational methods for future scholarly communications will be discussed
through a metaphorical "potato commons." The differences between potatoes at a
grocery store, a co-op, a farmer's market, and a commons will be used to
illuminate similar differences in how we work together and share scholarship.
This lighthearted approach will incorporate a smattering of commons theory to
open a window to a digestible understanding of what a scholarly commons might
be and beg the question, "Is that what we really want?"

# Format
