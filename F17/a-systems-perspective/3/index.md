# Description

This capstone session tries to connect the past and future visions of
scholarship, using systems theory to provide a way forward. The goal of this
session will be to find leverage points that could be used to intervene in the
current system to affect change, so that ultimately, our ability to affect the
world with greater light and understanding will be magnified.

# Format

A 30--45 minute workshop session.

This is part three of three workshop sessions. The first is <cite>[The
Scholarly Commons: a systems perspective of the past and present][1]</cite>,
and the second is <cite>[The Scholarly Commons: systemic visions of the
future][2]</cite>. They could be done individually and stand-alone if needed,
but would be best held sequentially.

Discussion-style.
