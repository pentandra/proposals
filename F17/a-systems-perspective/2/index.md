Over the past two years, the Scholarly Commons Working Group has embarked on
several efforts to gather thoughts and ideas for a collective vision of the
Scholarly Commons. This session will contribute to this larger effort,
specifically by reaching out to others that are working on efforts for the
future of scholarly communications in some way, to see what we can learn by
evaluating these prospective systems of scholarship.

After a brief introduction to the terminology and models from systems theory,
such as stocks, flows, and feedback loops, prospective systems will be
introduced, and we will work in groups to analyze these systems, with the goal
of converging upon a collective understanding of the systemic elements,
interconnections, and purpose of the scholarship of the future.

# Format

A 45--60 or 60--75 minute workshop session.

This is part two of three workshop sessions. The first is <cite>[The Scholarly
Commons: a systems perspective of the past and present][1]</cite>, and the last
is <cite>[The Scholarly Commons: systemic change][3]</cite>. They could be done
individually and stand-alone if needed, but would be best held sequentially.

Here is a rough outline of this second workshop:

- 10 minutes, Quick recap of previous session. Intro to systems thinking.
- 15 minutes, 1--2 minute soapbox for each system. Invite contributor/advocate to present on their system. BYOS, but we will provide some as well.
- 12 minutes × 3, Break into groups. Evaluate and diagram each system from a systems point of view. Switch systems at least three times.
- 10--15 minutes, Plenary to discuss and share
- 10 minutes, Plenary, asking questions such as the following:

What's the best stuff up here? What do we want to see for sure in any future
system of scholarship? What is essential, what is vital, what is central? What
are things that could be more in the periphery? Are there things that are not
as important? Which pieces or connections are from the current system? Are they
required, or are they hiding something? Which are new? (label each somehow)

We will ideally find elements and connections that are needed for any starter
system.
