# Description

<figure class="grab bq">

> If a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left

In order to change the culture of scholarship, we first need to understand what
that culture is. Through an interactive analysis of the past and present
"systems" of scholarship, this session will help us to come to a better
understanding of the complex system that we call "scholarship". A system is
more than the sum of its parts. To come to a deeper understanding of this
system we must also include its interconnections and purpose.

We will start by identifying and relating the elements of historic and modern
systems of scholarship using the terminology and models from systems theory,
such as stocks, flows, and feedback loops that have created and still motivate
current incentives, workflows, business models, thought patterns, and forms of
communication of scholarship. After a brief introduction to these concepts, we
will alternate between group work and plenary discussions as we analyze how the
current system came about and implications of the forces and interactions that
are at play.

A systems perspective will help us to systematically remove the blinders,
making the invisible visible, so we can see the system for what it is and
recognize both the traps and opportunities of our current situation. With a
real understanding of how the system works, we then will be armed with the
knowledge and power needed to truly create something better.

This is a leading exercise to help lay a groundwork for future discussions.

# Format

A [75--90]{.oldstyle} minute workshop session.

This is part one of three workshop sessions. The second is <cite>[The Scholarly
Commons: systemic visions of the future][2]</cite>, and the last is <cite>[The
Scholarly Commons: systemic change][3]</cite>. They could be done individually
and stand-alone if needed, but would be best held sequentially.

Here is a rough outline of this first workshop:

- [10]{.oldstyle} minutes, theory/how to draw
- [15]{.oldstyle} minutes, groups - historical systems
- [5--10]{.oldstyle} minutes, plenary - share
- [20]{.oldstyle} minutes, groups - current system
- [5--10]{.oldstyle} minutes, plenary - share
- [15--20]{.oldstyle} minutes, plenary - distill realities
- rest of time, plenary - implications
