If I were building this, I wouldâ€¦

* build something that aligned with the culture of the Scholarly Commons
* made of interoperable components
* authenticate via ORCiD
* and the IndieWeb protocol
* and start with bringing in bits of knowledge from around the web
* including existing declarations (WP1)
* reconstruct our process over the last year and a half (WP1)
* and map that knowledge (WP2)
* via a beautiful user experience
* the process trees would be a scholarly output of their own (WP3)
* each workflow would be exposed as a community best practice for a specific situation
* and also as the actual 'what happened' for a researcher
* these two would form a processual backbone of the Scholarly Commons
* and would make research reproducible
* build an ontology based upon DecisionML and Design Intent Ontology (rio?)
* and expose them as such
* build adapters or connections to various services to automate the process
* such as Google Docs, Dropbox, Github, dat, OSF, Solid
* the principles would be live (WP2)
* stuff would happen via Hydra
* host it at scholarlycommons.org
* to test out processes, ideas, and interactions
* and use machine learning on them
* so that we can have assisted research
