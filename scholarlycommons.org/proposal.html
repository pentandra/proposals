<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> What is needed for a scholarly commons?</h2>
<p>Decision trees are a good start, but they are not enough on their own to create a viable alternative to the current system. According to Diffusion of Innovations we need a viable alternative that can be trialed, and I’m not convinced that we have an existing viable alternative, hypothetical or otherwise. We need a viable alternative, distinct and comprehensive enough to be considered an alternative system of scholarly communication. We also need this alternative system to be better than anything currently available, so that there is real motivation to leave behind old practices and adopt new.</p>
<p>The Scholarly Commons is a culture, but we’re missing critical infrastructure to tie everything together and allow the culture of the Scholarly Commons to thrive. It is not enough for disciplines to ‘spin up their own variety of commoning’ (<a href="https://cybersocialstructure.org/2016/10/18/think-of-science-like-an-incurable-intellectual-disease-part-3/">Bruce Caron</a>). In order to tie everything together and avoid perpetuating cultural and disciplinary silos, we need ‘technical duct tape’ (also Bruce) harnessing the power of the Web to provide the machine interoperability needed to tie together disciplines, cultures, languages, questions, answers, inputs, outputs, data, sources of data, evidences, standards, principles, practices, tools, projects, organizations, funders, individuals, interfaces, and expectations across the globe in a unified way.</p>
<p>The work is composed of three interrelated subprojects:</p>

<p><em>See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iZplXo3meTR5164fbkk40-CrauZk89PgxvsZ_jDPTCQ/edit" title="Defining the Commons Platform Proposal">Defining the Commons Platform</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eF30cXlPhKHW9brLonb2UJkM4Gk5vcpbegS3D-3tOnA/edit?usp=sharing">my 400 word response</a> for some background thoughts, though this is still a moving target.</em></p>
<p>The most fundamental purpose of this subproject is to provide a place to explore and eventually answer the question: <em>what is the Scholarly Commons?</em> It will build upon all the work that we have done in the past as a steering committee and working group, as well as the outputs from the workshops in Madrid, Portland, and San Diego. Going forward, it will provide an open and even playing field for anyone to contribute to the definition of the Scholarly Commons.</p>
<p>The output of this subproject will be a modern, reusable, archetypical research system, aligned with the culture of the Scholarly Commons, that could be used for accomplishing Concept II (focused on the research process) of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGiLTimTeue-Gumk0BZZfzOeDHNJI8jvRRYY84ZHVcc/edit?usp=sharing" title="Doable pathways to the Scholarly Commons">Doable pathways to the Scholarly Commons</a>, discussed during the San Diego workshop. The Scholarly Commons should be a jumping-off point to new ways of working together, taking the best ideas of how to do scholarship in a modern setting, setting aside as many of the undesirable social and cultural limitations as possible.</p>
<p>One of my greatest takeaways from the main track of the San Diego workshop was that because the research processes were made explicit and studied this way, it allowed the workshop attendees to reason about, find patterns, and learn from them. With this end in mind, a central feature of this system will be exposing the researcher’s path explicitly. From the researcher’s perspective, the entire research process could be viewed as a sequence of decisions. These decisions and the process of how they came about should form the basis of research publication and collaboration.</p>
<p>If we don’t make that process explicit, how will we be able to share, reproduce, or assess the differences? If we keep the process implicit, or even leave it to post facto analysis to attempt to reveal it all alone, we are missing the whole point, and we end up not very far from where we are now: publishing <em>about</em> the research, instead of publishing <em>research</em>, and our ability to effectively common will be impeded. What is needed is an infrastructure where, as Jeffrey Schnapp says in his presentation on <a href="http://jeffreyschnapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/HH_lectures_Schnapp_01.pdf">Knowledge Design</a>, the process <em>is</em> the product.</p>
<p>The general approach will build on the early work of on Issue-Based Information Systems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-Based_Information_System" title="Issue-based Information Systems on Wikipedia">IBIS</a>), Knowledge Media Institute’s <a href="http://projects.kmi.open.ac.uk/scholonto/">Scholonto</a> later ideas, other thoughts from the brightest minds on the future of scholarly communication, and our own research on how to fit this all together that we have conducted over the past several years. It will implement the best thinking on evidence and argumentation in a collaborative research context, bringing in bits of knowledge from around the Web, including existing declarations (building on WP1), and mapping that knowledge together (building on WP2), all within a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, this system will integrate with and connect current tools, standards, and implementations instead of replacing existing functionality.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.2.2</span> The fundamental building block of scholarly communication</h3>
<p>The basic premise is that our current outputs, implementations, and approaches to scholarly communications, such as papers and working groups, are inherently closed, and not in harmony with the culture of the Scholarly Commons. Openness is more than just licensing and filetype compatibility, or even open admission to a knowledge club. We need a way to open the process so that people can get involved and can collaborate without the barrier of time or place.</p>
<p>The question is the most fundamental building block of scholarly communication. <a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/not-what-not-who-or-how-but-why-is-open/" title="Not what, not who, or how, but Why is Open? by Cameron Neylon">All researchers question</a>. Questions are the bedrock upon which all answers are pursued. Discovery happens after finding the right question to ask. Making public one’s own questions exposes the mind of the researcher, and is the mental and cultural equivalent of a teacher flipping a class. Questions partition research into tractable units of work. Questions are the intellectual undercurrent of the research process. Questions invite the culture of openness that we are so desiring to cultivate.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is not just another application. It is not a Facebook for science. I think this approach is vital to the integrity of the Scholarly Commons. We need to expose research at the cellular level. We need to expose it at this level of granularity so that other people can involve themselves freely in research. Otherwise we’re still just dealing with closed groups, artifacts, and processes.</p>

<li>the process trees would be a scholarly output of their own (WP3)</li>

<li>these two would form a processual backbone of the Scholarly Commons</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.4.1</span> Visualization</h3>
<p><em>See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ciLAzl65ppmJ_GOPrpkA-s8XXLBmqocME1KkQ5adgUc/edit" title="Infrastructure Map Proposal">Infrastructure Map Proposal</a> for some background thoughts on this, as well as some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y8AZWIJN5mJ3xloxXblsSENmvl4meBn0H2rxUG8HIec/edit?usp=sharing">earlier emails</a>.</em></p>
<p>The visualization builds upon the data and understandings obtained from the <a href="#open-research-curation-system">open-research curation system</a> and the <a href="#research-guides">research guides</a> to help people (and machines) see how the commons works, or how the resources of the commons interact. Though scholarly commoning will be happening across all disciplines, in some form or another, scholarlycommons.org will be the place that we study <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> this commoning process actually happens, across all domains. Think of the people studying the scholarly commons as a <em><a href="https://cybersocialstructure.org/2016/10/03/think-of-science-like-an-incurable-intellectual-disease/">collective</a></em>.</p>
<p>The visualization is made of representations of the types of resources used in scholarly commoning, both interactional and artifactual. These resources are represented visually as smaller components of a greater whole. The components are a visual typology that will aid in understanding not only the details of the research process, but how the culture of the Scholarly Commons provides a more fluent and integrative research experience. Pieces of the research process only fit together in a certain sequence. This visual typology will depict and reinforce the sequential nature of how research actually happens or could potentially happen.</p>
<p>The overall visualization is dynamic, as new types of resources are discovered, and is based on an underlying map of the resources accessible to machines. It will connect things that have previously been unconnected. At any given point in time the map gives a picture of what the commons is at that particular point in time. It is not a top-down rendering of what we would like it to be, but a versioned representation of the actual resources and potential interactions between those resources. At first these resources will be more domain-agnostic, but over time, more and more domain-specific resources will be represented.</p>
